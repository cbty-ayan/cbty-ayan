Hi there 👋<br/>
Happy to see you here! Let me introduce myself.<br/>
I'm Ayan, an India based fullstack web-developer with a focus in frontend, creating thoughtful, intuitive interfaces.

I craft thoughtful, intuitive interfaces that captivate users and enhance their experiences. 
<!--With expertise in React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, Material UI, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Firebase, and more, I bring ideas to life and build dynamic web applications. 🚀-->

I'm an eternal learner, constantly exploring and keeping up with the latest trends. But my curiosity extends beyond development. I embrace diverse domains and thrive on multidisciplinary knowledge. 📚

Open to collaboration, I'm approachable and enjoy connecting with fellow developers. Let's learn from each other and make a positive impact on the community. 🤝

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new destinations, indulging in gadgets, and cherishing the company of my furry friends. 🌍📱

Let's connect on GitHub and embark on an exciting journey of growth, innovation, and coding excellence! 🚀
